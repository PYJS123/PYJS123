I am a programmer, who programs in P5.JS (based on The Processing Java Environment and a JavaScript library), Python and Pygame Zero, use HTML5 a lot, and have programming as a hobby.

I am heavily inspired by [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman), who also codes in P5.JS and Processing, and does frequent 'Coding challenges'.

You should check him out.

EARLY 2021: Recently started making [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) apps in [Dart](https://dart.dev)! Soon, I'll make a life sim with it.
